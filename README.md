# Good Vs Bad Fibonacci Sequence recursive functions
My first github repository. In this I go through the three ways of writting fibonacci series generator for given n.
1. General Recursive method, this method has O(2^n) time complexity.
2. Good fibonaci series generator, this method has O(n) time complexity.
3. Dynamic Programming method, this method has O(n) time complexity with O(n) space complexity.
4. Finally I print the trace for each of this methods for given n to visualize the recursion.
